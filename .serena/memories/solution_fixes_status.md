# Solution Files Fix Status

## Fixed âœ…
1. challenge09_solution.go - LockInfo type order corrected in both solution1 and solution2
2. challenge10_solution.go - isLessOrEqual marked as unused, PartitionBuffer type order fixed

## Remaining Issues
1. challenge12_solution.go - unused firstData variable
2. challenge13_solution.go - undefined updateProjections function
3. challenge14_solution.go - undefined SagaState and Event types  
4. solution06_resource_leak.go - FilePool/ConnectionPool method issues (Open, CloseAll, Init undefined)

## Strategy
Continue fixing one file at a time, focusing on type definition order and unused variable issues.
